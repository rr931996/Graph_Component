# Graph Component

## Overview

The `Graph` component is a React component that displays an interactive chart with various functionalities.

- **Dynamic Time Frames**: View data over different time periods such as 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, or maximum.
- **Fullscreen Mode**: Toggle fullscreen mode for an expanded view of the chart.
- **Tab Navigation**: Switch between different tabs including Summary, Chart, Statistics, Analysis, and Settings.
- **Custom Tooltip**: Uses a custom tooltip component to display additional data information.

## Installation

To use this component, make sure you have `react`, `recharts`, and `@ant-design/icons` installed in your project.
