# Graph Component

## Overview

- **Fullscreen Mode**: Toggle fullscreen mode for an expanded view of the chart.
- **Tab Navigation**: Switch between different tabs including Summary, Chart, Statistics, Analysis, and Settings.
- **Custom Tooltip**: Uses a custom tooltip component to display additional data information.
